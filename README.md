# What is this?
A library for Sensirion's miniature CO2 sensor, SCD41

## What's the difference between this and the official on from sensirion?
I only made this for my thesis. While sensirion's uses their own I2C and CRC library, i used Arduino's official wire.h and my own CRC library.

## Is this better than the official one?
I dont actually know yet since im still working on this

# Prerequisites
Wire.h
