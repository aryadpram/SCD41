# What is this?
An arduino library for one of Sensirion's CO2 sensor, SCD41

### Why make another one?
It's for for my thesis

### What's the difference between this and the official one from sensirion?
While sensirion's uses their own I2C and CRC library, i used Arduino's official wire.h and a slightly different CRC library (i mean how different a crc library can be?)

### Is this better than the official one?
I dont actually know yet since im still working on this

### Prerequisites
None :)
